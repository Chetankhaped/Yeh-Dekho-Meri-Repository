# 🚨 Insecure IoT Device Proof of Concept

> **⚠️ DISCLAIMER:** This project is for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**. It demonstrates a common vulnerability in IoT devices (Insecure Direct Object References / Lack of Authentication) to highlight the importance of securing hardware interfaces. Do not use this Code against systems you do not own or have permission to test.

## 📖 Overview

This project contains a simple demonstration of an **IoT Security Vulnerability**.

It consists of two parts:
1. **The Victim (ESP32):** A microcontroller simulating a "Critical System" (a simple LED) connected to WiFi. It exposes a web server with an **unauthenticated** endpoint to control the hardware.
2. **The Attacker (Python Script):** A script that scans for the device and exploits the open endpoint to manipulate the hardware state remotely without permission.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

*   **ESP32 Development Board** (e.g., ESP-WROOM-32)
*   Micro-USB Cable
*   (Optional) External LED if not using the built-in one (GPIO 2)

## 💻 Software Prerequisites

*   [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (configured for ESP32)
*   [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Setting up the Victim (ESP32)

1.  Open `esp32-microcontroller-code.c` in Arduino IDE.
2.  Create a new tab or header file named `secrets.h` in the same directory.
3.  Add your WiFi credentials to `secrets.h`:
    ```c
    #define WIFI_SSID "Your_WiFi_Name"
    #define WIFI_PASSWORD "Your_WiFi_Password"
    ```
4.  Connect your ESP32 and select the correct board and port in Arduino IDE.
5.  **Upload** the code.
6.  Open the **Serial Monitor** (115200 baud).
7.  Note the **IP Address** printed once WiFi connects (e.g., `192.168.1.105`).

### 2. Performing the "Attack" (Python)

1.  Ensure you have the `requests` library installed:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
2.  Open `hack-script.py`.
3.  Update the `TARGET_IP` variable with the IP address you saw in the Serial Monitor:
    ```python
    TARGET_IP = "192.168.1.105" # Example
    ```
4.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python hack-script.py
    ```

## 🎥 Expected Result

1.  The Python script will confirm the vulnerability: `[+] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED`.
2.  The script will rapidly toggle the "Critical System" (the LED on the ESP32 will flash).
3.  The ESP32 Serial Monitor will print warnings: `⚠ ALERT: System state changed via Web Request!`

## 🛡️ Security Lesson

This PoC demonstrates why **Authentication** and **Authorization** are crucial for IoT devices.

**How to fix the code?**
*   Implement a login mechanism.
*   Use API Keys or Tokens in the request headers.
*   Typically, devices should communicate over HTTPS/TLS to prevent replay attacks.
